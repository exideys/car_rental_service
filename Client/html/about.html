    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      At RentAuto, we believe that every journey should begin with confidence and comfort. Established in 2012, our company was founded on a simple idea: to make car rental easy, accessible, and transparent for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, we’ve grown from a small local agency to a trusted national brand, offering hundreds of vehicles across multiple cities. Our fleet includes compact cars for urban travel, spacious SUVs for family trips, and premium sedans for business needs — all regularly inspected, clean, and ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that time is valuable. That’s why our booking process is fast and fully online — no paperwork, no long queues. Our flexible rental terms, real-time availability, and affordable pricing allow you to plan your trip with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes us different is our commitment to customer care. Our support team is available 24/7 to assist you before, during, and after your rental. Whether it’s a flat tire at midnight or a last-minute extension request, we’re here to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sustainability also matters to us. That’s why we’re expanding our electric vehicle lineup and implementing eco-friendly practices across our operations. We believe that the future of travel should be not only convenient — but responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every kilometer you drive with RentAuto is backed by a promise: fair service, no hidden fees, and vehicles you can trust. We’re more than just a rental company — we’re your travel partner.
    </p>
    <p class="closing">
      Thank you for choosing RentAuto. Let’s get you moving.
